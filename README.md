# Projects
I am a beginner at python. These are my simple projects mainly with conditionals. I have covered functions, strings, modules, loops, lists and conditionals. I know a little tuples, modules, libraries etc.
Currently doing the Python 3 course for beginners in Codecademy and have covered more than half of the syllabus.
